# eCommerceSimulator

This software is an agent-based model to simulate the e-commerce behavior between agents and markets. Unlike known agent-based model simulators like Repast, eCommerceSimulator is highly specialized and customizable for e-commerce, considering the endorsement theory. Altough the source code of eCommerceSimulator is freely available, we provide a jar compilation.

## Usage

The eCommerceSimulator software requires an Excel file that specifies the experiment configurator for the simulation as well as the calibration data (see figures below).

When all executions of an experiment finished, an excel file with many (and configurable) data from the experiment as well as a chart of each simulation (see figures below).
